# 🕵️‍♂️ Case 1: The Hiring Bot That Ghosted Women

## 🧠 What’s Happening:
A tech company uses an AI-powered Hiring Bot to scan thousands of job applications. 
It filters out candidates before any human ever reads their CVs. But here’s the catch:
 women who took career breaks (often to care for family) are rejected at a much higher rate.

## 🚨 What’s Problematic:
This AI system likely learned bias from historical hiring data that already discriminates against career gaps.
 Without understanding the context, the bot is unfairly filtering out qualified female candidates. 
Even worse — there's no explanation or transparency behind these decisions.

## 🛠️ One Responsible Fix:
- Retrain the model using **fairness-aware data** that values diverse career paths.
- Add context-aware logic to avoid penalizing career breaks unfairly.
- Introduce **transparent rejection feedback** so applicants understand the decision and can improve.
