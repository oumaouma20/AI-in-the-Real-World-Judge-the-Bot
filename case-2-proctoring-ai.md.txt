# 🕵️‍♂️ Case 2: The Proctoring AI That Cried "Cheater!"

## 🧠 What’s Happening:
A school uses online proctoring AI during exams to monitor students’ webcams. The AI flags students who look around, move a lot, or appear “distracted” — and automatically marks them as potential cheaters.

## 🚨 What’s Problematic:
This AI doesn't account for **neurodiversity** or physical differences. Students with ADHD, autism, anxiety, or motor tics are more likely to behave in ways that the system deems "suspicious." The result? False accusations and unfair penalties.

## 🛠️ One Responsible Fix:
- Add **multi-modal behavior analysis** (e.g., keyboard/mouse activity, sound, time-based context) instead of relying on webcam input alone.
- Require **human review** before making disciplinary decisions.
- Provide a way for flagged students to contest decisions, promoting accountability and fairness.
